## Summary
This particular dataset does not show any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. After filtering our data, our data frame contained 0 reviews from the Vine program. I went back to the original dataframe and filtered it for reviews in the Vine program. The original dataset only contained 2 reviews from the Vine program, which can be seen [here](https://github.com/azarowj/Amazon_Vine_Analysis/blob/main/VineProgram.png). If I wanted to look further into the possibility of positivity bias in the Vine program, I would need to do this analysis over with a different dataset.
